What corrections did you have to make, and how did you make them?
    Added language for the html. --> <html lang="en">
    Added aria-label attributes in the search section. --> aria-label="search for artists or songs"

Is this interface functional without the use of a mouse (i.e., just using keyboard keys)? Why or why not?
    Yes. You can use tab key to select, search the song you want, and enter the song.

What are other accessibility tests or features you added or would be interested in learning about?
    I would be interested in learning how to add other options in the sidebar, such as, genre, country, 100 best songs, etc.
